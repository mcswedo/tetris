This is a free version of Tetris (created and owned by Alexey Pajitnov, The Tetris Company, and EA Games) 
programmed in Javascript by Michael Swedo, Deanna Sulli, and Zachary Fuller.

--- VERSION 1.0 ---

Version 1.0 is content-complete, featuring the "classic" style of tetris, without a "hold" feature and with only one block being shown in advance.
It implements all the standard features - 7 block styles, a random generator for the blocks, movement, increase speed, and rotation.
Also, a track of the number of lines completed is kept, and at every 10 lines, the game "levels up" and the speed increases.

Things that are not implemented that will (probably) come in a later version:
  Native Phone support for Android using PhoneGap
  Native Phone support for iPhone
  Responsive canvas
  Start screen
